CARROLL And now you are going to move here .
ALICE Let me move myself .
CARROLL When you have traveled all along the board this way and haven &apos;t been taken by the enemy you may be a queen .
ALICE Why do people always play with kings and queens ?
Mother has them in her playing cards too .
Look !
&#91; _ ALICE goes to the mantel and takes a pack of playing cards from the ledge . _ &#93; Here &apos;s the King of Hearts and here &apos;s his wife ; she &apos;s the Queen of Hearts--isn &apos;t she cross-looking ?
wants to bite one &apos;s head off .
&#91; _ CARROLL moves a pawn . _ &#93; You &apos;re playing against yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
CARROLL That &apos;s one way of keeping in practice , Alice ; I have friends in the university who want to beat me .
ALICE But if you play against yourself I should think you &apos;d want to cheat !
CARROLL Does a nice little girl like you cheat when she plays against herself ?
ALICE Oh !
I _ never _ do !
I &apos;d scold myself hard .
I always pretend I &apos;m _ two _ people too .
It &apos;s lots of fun , isn &apos;t it ?
Sometimes when I &apos;m all alone I walk up to the looking glass and talk to the other Alice .
She &apos;s so silly , that Alice ; she can &apos;t do anything by herself .
She just mocks me all the time .
When I laugh , she laughs , when I point my finger at her , she points her finger at me , and when I stick my tongue out at her she sticks her tongue out at me !
Kitty has a twin too , haven &apos;t you darling ?
&#91; _ ALICE goes to the mirror to show Kitty her twin . _ &#93; CARROLL I &apos;ll have to write a book some day about Alice--Alice in wonderland , &quot; Child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder ! &quot;
or , Alice through the looking glass !
ALICE Don &apos;t you wish sometimes you could go into looking-glass house ?
See !
&#91; _ ALICE stands on an armchair and looks into the mirror . _ &#93; There &apos;s the room you can see through the glass ; it &apos;s just the same as our living-room here , only the things go the other way .
I can see all of it--all but the bit just behind the fireplace .
Oh !
I do wish I could see that bit !
I want so much to know if they &apos;ve a fire there .
You never _ can _ tell , you know , unless our fire smokes .
Then smoke comes up in that room too--but that may be just to make it look as if they had a fire--just to pretend they had .
The books are something like our books , only the words go the wrong way .
Won &apos;t there ever be any way of our getting through , uncle ?
CARROLL Do you think Kitty would find looking-glass milk digestible ?
ALICE It doesn &apos;t sound awful good , does it ; but I might leave her at home .
She &apos;s been into an awful lot of mischief today .
She found sister &apos;s knitting and chased the ball all over the garden where sister was playing croquet with the neighbors .
And I ran and ran after the naughty little thing until I was all out of breath and so tired !
I am tired .
&#91; _ She yawns and makes herself comfortable in the armchair . _ &#93; CARROLL &#91; _ Replaces the playing cards on the mantel and consults his watch . _ &#93; Take a nap .
Yes , you have time before tea .
ALICE &#91; _ Half asleep . _ &#93; We &apos;re going to have mock turtle soup for supper !
I heard mamma tell the cook not to pepper it too much .
CARROLL What a funny little rabbit it is , nibbling all the time !
&#91; _ He leans gently over the back of her chair , and seeing that she is going to sleep puts out the lamp light and leaves the room .
A red glow from the fireplace illumines ALICE . _ &#93; &#91; _ Dream music .
A bluish light reveals the RED CHESS QUEEN and the WHITE CHESS QUEEN in the mirror . _ &#93; RED QUEEN &#91; _ Points to ALICE and says in a mysterious voice . _ &#93; There she is , let &apos;s call her over .
WHITE QUEEN Do you think she &apos;ll come ?
RED QUEEN I &apos;ll call softly , Alice !
WHITE QUEEN Hist , Alice .
RED QUEEN Alice !
WHITE QUEEN Hush--if she wakes and catches us-- BOTH QUEENS Alice , come through into looking-glass house !
&#91; _ Their hands beckon her . _ &#93; ALICE &#91; _ Rises , and talks sleepily .
The Queens disappear .
ALICE climbs from the arm of the chair to the back of another and so on up to the mantel ledge , where she picks her way daintily between the vases . _ &#93; I--don &apos;t--know--how--I--can--get--through .
I &apos;ve tried--before--but the glass was hard--and I was afraid of cutting--my fingers-- &#91; _ She feels the glass and is amazed to find it like gauze . _ &#93; Why , it &apos;s soft like gauze ; it &apos;s turning into a sort of mist ; why , it &apos;s easy to get through !
_ Why--why _ --I &apos;m going _ through _ !
&#91; _ She disappears . _ &#93; SCENE TWO &#91; _ Is Scene One , reversed .
The portieres are black and red squares like a chessboard .
A soft radiance follows the characters mysteriously .
As the curtain rises ALICE comes through the looking glass ; steps down , looks about in wonderment and goes to see if there is a &quot; fire . &quot;
The RED QUEEN rises out of the grate and faces her haughtily . _ &#93; ALICE Why , you &apos;re the Red Queen !
RED QUEEN Of course I am !
Where do you come from ?
And where are you going ?
Look up , speak nicely , and don &apos;t twiddle your fingers !
ALICE I only wanted to see what the looking glass was like .
Perhaps I &apos;ve lost my way .
RED QUEEN I don &apos;t know what you mean by your way ; all the ways about here belong to _ me _ .
Curtsey while you &apos;re thinking what to say .
It saves time .
ALICE I &apos;ll try it when I go home ; the next time I &apos;m a little late for dinner .
RED QUEEN It &apos;s time for you to answer now ; open your mouth a _ little _ wider when you speak , and always say , &quot; Your Majesty . &quot;
I suppose you don &apos;t want to lose your name ?
ALICE No , indeed .
RED QUEEN And yet I don &apos;t know , only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it !
For instance , if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons , she would call out &quot; come here , &quot; and there she would have to leave off , because there wouldn &apos;t be any name for her to call , and of course you wouldn &apos;t have to go , you know .
ALICE That would never do , I &apos;m sure ; the governess would never think of excusing me from lessons for that .
If she couldn &apos;t remember my name , she &apos;d call me &quot; Miss , &quot; as the servants do .
RED QUEEN Well , if she said &quot; Miss , &quot; and didn &apos;t say anything more , of course you &apos;d miss your lessons .
I dare say you can &apos;t even read this book .
ALICE It &apos;s all in some language I don &apos;t know .
Why , it &apos;s a looking-glass book , of course !
And if I hold it up to a glass , the words will all go the right way again .
JABBERWOCKY &apos; Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe ; All mimsy were the borogoves , And the mome raths outgrabe .
It seems very pretty , but it &apos;s _ rather _ hard to understand ; somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas--only I don &apos;t exactly know what they are .
RED QUEEN I daresay you don &apos;t know your geography either .
Look at the map !
&#91; _ She takes a right angle course to the portieres and points to them with her sceptre . _ &#93; ALICE It &apos;s marked out just like a big chessboard .
I wouldn &apos;t mind being a pawn , though of course I should like to be a Red Queen best .
RED QUEEN That &apos;s easily managed .
When you get to the eighth square you &apos;ll be a Queen .
It &apos;s a huge game of chess that &apos;s being played--all over the world .
Come on , we &apos;ve got to run .
Faster , don &apos;t try to talk .
ALICE I can &apos;t .
RED QUEEN Faster , faster .
ALICE Are we nearly there ?
RED QUEEN Nearly there !
Why , we passed it ten minutes ago .
Faster .
You may rest a little now .
ALICE Why , I do believe we &apos;re in the same place .
Everything &apos;s just as it was .
&#91; Illustration &#93; RED QUEEN Of course it is , what would you have it ?
ALICE Well , in our country you &apos;d generally get to somewhere else--if you ran very fast for a long time as we &apos;ve been doing .
RED QUEEN A slow sort of country .
Now _ here _ you see , it takes all the running _ you _ can do , to keep in the same place .
If you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that .
ALICE I &apos;d rather not try , please !
I &apos;m quite content to stay here--only I _ am _ so hot and thirsty .
RED QUEEN I know what you &apos;d like .
&#91; _ She takes a little box out of her pocket . _ &#93; Have a biscuit ?
&#91; _ ALICE , not liking to refuse , curtseys as she takes the biscuit and chokes . _ &#93; RED QUEEN While you &apos;re refreshing yourself , I &apos;ll just take the measurements .
&#91; _ She takes a ribbon out of her pocket and measures the map with it . _ &#93; At the end of two yards I shall give you your directions--have another biscuit ?
ALICE No thank you , one &apos;s _ quite _ enough .
RED QUEEN Thirst quenched , I hope ?
At the end of three yards I shall repeat them--for fear of your forgetting them .
At the end of _ four _ , I shall say good-bye .
And at the end of five , I shall go !
That Square belongs to Humpty Dumpty and that Square to the Gryphon and Mock Turtle and that Square to the Queen of Hearts .
But you make no remark ?
ALICE I--I didn &apos;t know I had to make one--just then .
RED QUEEN You _ should _ have said , &quot; It &apos;s extremely kind of you to tell me all this , &quot; however , we &apos;ll suppose it said .
Four !
Good-bye !
Five !
&#91; _ RED QUEEN vanishes in a gust of wind behind the portieres .
Rabbit music .
WHITE RABBIT comes out of the fireplace and walks about the room hurriedly .
He wears a checked coat , carries white kid gloves in one hand , a fan in the other and takes out his watch to look at it anxiously . _ &#93; WHITE RABBIT Oh the Duchess !
the Duchess !
Oh !
won &apos;t she be savage if I &apos;ve kept her waiting !
ALICE I &apos;ve never seen a rabbit with a waistcoat and a watch !
And a waistcoat pocket !
If you please , sir-- WHITE RABBIT Oh !
&#91; _ He drops fan and gloves in fright and dashes out by way of the portieres in a gust of wind .
ALICE picks up the fan and playfully puts on the gloves .
The portieres flap in the breeze and a shawl flies in . _ &#93; ALICE &#91; _ Catches the shawl and looks about for the owner ; then meets the WHITE QUEEN . _ &#93; I &apos;m very glad I happened to be in the way .
WHITE QUEEN &#91; _ Runs in wildly , both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying , and cries in a helpless frightened way . _ &#93; Bread-and-butter , bread-and-butter .
ALICE Am I addressing the White Queen ?
WHITE QUEEN Well , yes , if you call that a-dressing .
It isn &apos;t my notion of the thing , at all .
ALICE If your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin , I &apos;ll do it as well as I can .
WHITE QUEEN But I don &apos;t want it done at all .
I &apos;ve been a-dressing myself for the last two hours .
ALICE Every single thing &apos;s crooked , and you &apos;re all over pins ; may I put your shawl straight for you ?
WHITE QUEEN I don &apos;t know what &apos;s the matter with it !
It &apos;s out of temper .
I &apos;ve pinned it here , and I &apos;ve pinned it there , but there &apos;s no pleasing it .
ALICE It _ can &apos;t _ go straight , you know , if you pin it all on one side , and dear me , what a state your hair is in !
WHITE QUEEN The brush has got entangled in it !
And I lost the comb yesterday .
ALICE &#91; _ Takes out the brush and arranges the QUEEN &apos;S hair . _ &#93; You look better now !
But really you should have a lady &apos;s maid !
WHITE QUEEN I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll take you with pleasure .
Two pence a week and jam every other day .
ALICE &#91; _ Who cannot help laughing . _ &#93; I don &apos;t want you to hire me--and I don &apos;t care for jam .
WHITE QUEEN It &apos;s very good jam .
ALICE Well , I don &apos;t want any today , at any rate .
WHITE QUEEN You couldn &apos;t have it if you _ did _ want it .
The rule is , jam tomorrow and jam yesterday--but never jam today .
ALICE It must come sometimes to &quot; jam today . &quot;
WHITE QUEEN No , it can &apos;t , it &apos;s jam every _ other _ day ; today isn &apos;t any _ other _ day , you know .
ALICE I don &apos;t understand you , it &apos;s dreadfully confusing !
WHITE QUEEN That &apos;s the effect of living backwards , it always makes one a little giddy at first-- ALICE Living backwards !
I never heard of such a thing !
WHITE QUEEN But there &apos;s one great advantage in it--that one &apos;s memory works both ways .
ALICE I &apos;m sure _ mine _ only works one way .
I can &apos;t remember things before they happen .
WHITE QUEEN It &apos;s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards .
ALICE What sort of things do you remember best ?
WHITE QUEEN Oh , things that happened the week after next .
For instance now : &#91; _ She sticks a large piece of plaster on her finger . _ &#93; There &apos;s the King &apos;s messenger--he &apos;s in prison being punished ; and the trial doesn &apos;t even begin till next Wednesday ; and of course the crime comes last of all .
ALICE Suppose he never commits the crime ?
WHITE QUEEN &#91; _ Binding the plaster with ribbon . _ &#93; That would be all the better , wouldn &apos;t it ?
ALICE Of course it would be all the better , but it wouldn &apos;t be all the better his being punished .
WHITE QUEEN You &apos;re wrong _ there _ , at any rate ; were _ you _ ever punished ?
ALICE Only for faults .
WHITE QUEEN And you were all the better for it , I know !
ALICE Yes , but then I _ had _ done the things I was punished for ; that makes all the difference .
WHITE QUEEN But if you hadn &apos;t done them that would have been better still ; better and better and better !
ALICE There &apos;s a mistake somewhere-- WHITE QUEEN &#91; _ Screams like an engine whistle , and shakes her hand . _ &#93; Oh , Oh , Oh !
My finger &apos;s bleeding .
Oh , Oh , Oh !
ALICE What _ is _ the matter ?
Have you pricked your finger ?
WHITE QUEEN I haven &apos;t pricked it yet--but I soon shall--Oh , Oh , Oh !
ALICE When do you expect to do it ?
WHITE QUEEN When I fasten my shawl again ; the brooch will come undone directly .
Oh , Oh !
&#91; _ Brooch flies open and she clutches it wildly . _ &#93; ALICE Take care !
you &apos;re holding it all crooked !
WHITE QUEEN &#91; _ Pricks her finger and smiles . _ &#93; That accounts for the bleeding , you see ; now you understand the way things happen here .
ALICE But why don &apos;t you scream now ?
&#91; Illustration &#93; WHITE QUEEN Why , I &apos;ve done all the screaming already .
What would be the good of having it all over again ?
Oh !
it &apos;s time to run if you want to stay in the same place !
Come on !
ALICE No , no !
Not so fast !
I &apos;m getting dizzy ! !
WHITE QUEEN Faster , faster !
ALICE Everything &apos;s black before my eyes !
&#91; _ There is music , and the sound of rushing wind , and in the darkness the WHITE QUEEN cries : &quot; Faster , faster &quot; ; ALICE gasps : &quot; I can &apos;t--please stop &quot; ; and the QUEEN replies : &quot; Then you can &apos;t stay in the same place .
I &apos;ll have to drop you behind .
Faster--faster , good-bye .
&quot; _ &#93; SCENE THREE _ When the curtain rises one sees nothing but odd black lanterns with orange lights , hanging , presumably , from the sky .
The scene lights up slowly revealing ALICE seated on two large cushions .
She has been &quot; dropped behind &quot; by the WHITE QUEEN and is dazed to find herself in a strange hall with many peculiar doors and knobs too high to reach . _ ALICE Oh !
my head !
Where am I ?
Oh dear , Oh dear !
&#91; _ She staggers up and to her amazement finds herself smaller than the table . _ &#93; I &apos;ve never been smaller than any table before !
I &apos;ve always been able to reach the knobs !
What a curious feeling .
Oh !
I &apos;m shrinking .
It &apos;s the fan--the gloves !
&#91; _ She throws them away , feels her head and measures herself against table and doors . _ &#93; Oh !
saved in time !
But I never--never-- WHITE RABBIT Oh !
my fan and gloves !
Where _ are _ my-- ALICE Oh !
Mr. Rabbit--please help me out--I want to go home--I want to go home-- WHITE RABBIT Oh !
the Duchess !
Oh !
my fur and whiskers !
She &apos;ll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets !
Oh !
_ you _ have them !
ALICE I &apos;m sorry--you dropped them , you know-- WHITE RABBIT &#91; _ Picks up fan and gloves and patters off . _ &#93; She &apos;ll chop off your head !
ALICE If you please sir--where am I ? --won &apos;t you please--tell me how to get out--I want to get out-- WHITE RABBIT &#91; _ Looking at his watch . _ &#93; Oh !
my ears and whiskers , how late it &apos;s getting .
&#91; _ A trap door gives way and RABBIT disappears .
ALICE dashes after only in time to have the trap door bang in her face . _ &#93; ALICE &#91; _ Amazed . _ &#93; It &apos;s a rabbit-hole--I &apos;m small enough to fit it too !
If I shrink any more it might end in my going out altogether like a candle .
I wonder what I would be like then !
What does the flame of a candle look like after the candle is blown out ?
I &apos;ve never seen such a thing !
HUMPTY DUMPTY &#91; _ Sits on the wall . _ &#93; Don &apos;t stand chattering to yourself like that , but tell me your name and your business .
ALICE My _ name _ is Alice , but-- HUMPTY DUMPTY It &apos;s a stupid name enough , what does it mean ?
ALICE _ Must _ a name mean something ?
HUMPTY DUMPTY Of course it must ; _ my _ name means the shape I am--and a good , handsome shape it is , too .
With a name like yours , you might be any shape , almost .
ALICE You &apos;re Humpty Dumpty !
Just like an egg .
HUMPTY DUMPTY It &apos;s _ very _ provoking , to be called an egg-- _ very _ .
ALICE I said you _ looked _ like an egg , Sir , and some eggs are very pretty , you know .
HUMPTY DUMPTY Some people have no more sense than a baby .
ALICE Why do you sit here all alone ?
HUMPTY DUMPTY Why , because there &apos;s nobody with me .
Did you think I didn &apos;t know the answer to _ that _ ?
Ask another .
ALICE Don &apos;t you think you &apos;d be safer down on the ground ?
That wall &apos;s so very narrow .
HUMPTY DUMPTY What tremendously easy riddles you ask !
Of course I don &apos;t think so .
Take a good look at me !
I &apos;m one that has spoken to a king , I am ; to show you I &apos;m not proud , you may shake hands with me !
&#91; _ He leans forward to offer ALICE his hand but she is too small to reach it . _ &#93; However , this conversation is going on a little too fast ; let &apos;s go back to the last remark but one .
ALICE I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t remember it .
HUMPTY DUMPTY In that case we start fresh , and it &apos;s my turn to choose a subject .
ALICE You talk about it just as if it were a game .
HUMPTY DUMPTY So here &apos;s a question for you .
How old did you say you were ?
ALICE Seven years and six months .
HUMPTY DUMPTY Wrong !
You never said a word about it .
Now if you &apos;d asked _ my _ advice , I &apos;d have said , &quot; Leave off at seven--but-- &quot; ALICE I never ask advice about growing .
HUMPTY DUMPTY Too proud ?
ALICE What a beautiful belt you &apos;ve got on .
At least , a beautiful cravat , I should have said--no , a belt , I mean--I beg your pardon .
If only I knew which was neck and which was waist .
HUMPTY DUMPTY It is a-- _ most--provoking _ --thing , when a person doesn &apos;t know a cravat from a belt .
ALICE I know it &apos;s very ignorant of me .
HUMPTY DUMPTY It &apos;s a cravat , child , and a beautiful one , as you say .
There &apos;s glory for you .
ALICE I don &apos;t know what you mean by &quot; glory . &quot;
HUMPTY DUMPTY When I use a word , it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less .
ALICE The question is , whether you _ can _ make words mean different things .
HUMPTY DUMPTY The question is , which is to be master--that &apos;s all .
Impenetrability !
That &apos;s what I say !
ALICE Would you tell me , please , what that means ?
HUMPTY DUMPTY I meant by &quot; impenetrability &quot; that we &apos;ve had enough of that subject , and it would be just as well if you &apos;d mention what you mean to do next , as I suppose you don &apos;t mean to stop here all the rest of your life .
ALICE That &apos;s a great deal to make one word mean .
HUMPTY DUMPTY When I make a word do a lot of work like that I always pay it extra .
ALICE Oh !
HUMPTY DUMPTY Ah , you should see &apos; em come round me of a Saturday night , for to get their wages , you know .
That &apos;s all--Good-bye .
ALICE Good-bye till we meet again .
HUMPTY DUMPTY I shouldn &apos;t know you again , if we _ did _ meet , you &apos;re so exactly like other people .
ALICE The face is what one goes by , generally .
HUMPTY DUMPTY That &apos;s just what I complain of .
Your face is the same as everybody has--the two eyes--so--nose in the middle , mouth under .
It &apos;s always the same .
Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose , for instance--or the mouth at the top--that would be _ some _ help .
ALICE It wouldn &apos;t look nice .
HUMPTY DUMPTY Wait till you &apos;ve tried !
Good-bye .
&#91; _ He disappears as he came . _ &#93; ALICE Oh !
I forgot to ask him how to-- &#91; _ She tries to open the doors .
They are all locked ; she begins to weep .
She walks weeping to a high glass table and sits down on its lower ledge .
She sits on a big golden key and picks it up in surprise .
She tries it on all the doors but it does not fit .
She weeps and weeps--and Wonderland grows dark to her in her despair .
In the darkness she cries , &quot; Oh !
I &apos;m slipping !
Oh , Oh !
it &apos;s a lake ; Oh !
my tears !
I &apos;m floating ! &quot;
A mysterious light shows a &quot; Drink me &quot; sign around a bottle on the top of the table .
ALICE floats up to it panting , and holding on to the edge of the table takes up the bottle . _ &#93; ALICE It isn &apos;t marked poison .
&#91; _ She sips at it . _ &#93; This is good !
Tastes like cherry tart , custard , pineapple , roast turkey , toffy and hot buttered toast--all together .
Oh !
Oh !
I &apos;m letting out like a telescope .
&#91; _ A mysterious light shows her lengthening out . _ &#93; &#91; _ Music . _ &#93; But the lake is rising too .
Oh !
Oh !
it &apos;s deep !
I &apos;m drowning .
Help , help , I &apos;m drowning , I &apos;m drowning in my tears !
GRYPHON Hjckrrh .
Hjckrrh !
&#91; _ The GRYPHON , a huge green creature with big glittering wings , appears where HUMPTY DUMPTY had been and reaches glittering claws over to grab and save ALICE . _ &#93; SCENE FOUR _ Is symbolic of a wet and rocky shore in a weird green light .
The MOCK TURTLE is weeping dismally . _ GRYPHON Hjckrrh .
Hjckrrh .
Hjckrrh .
MOCK TURTLE &#91; _ Answers with his weeping . _ &#93; GRYPHON &#91; _ Drags ALICE in . _ &#93; Drop your tears into the sea with his .
ALICE He sobs as if he had a bone in his throat .
He sighs as if his heart would break .
What is his sorrow ?
MOCK TURTLE Oh , Gryphon , it &apos;s terrible !
GRYPHON It &apos;s all his fancy that .
Mock Turtle hasn &apos;t got no sorrow .
This here young lady , she wants for to know your history , she do .
MOCK TURTLE I &apos;ll tell it her .
Sit down both of you , and don &apos;t speak a word till I &apos;ve finished .
ALICE I don &apos;t see how you can _ ever _ finish , if you don &apos;t begin .
MOCK TURTLE Once , I was a real Turtle .
&#91; _ A long silence is broken only by the exclamations , &quot; Hjckrrh , &quot; of the GRYPHON and the heavy sobbing of the MOCK TURTLE . _ &#93; MOCK TURTLE When we were little , we went to school in the sea .
The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him tortoise-- ALICE Why did you call him Tortoise , if he wasn &apos;t one ?
MOCK TURTLE We called him Tortoise because he taught us ; really you are very dull .
GRYPHON You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question .
Drive on , old fellow !
Don &apos;t be all day about it !
MOCK TURTLE Yes , we went to school in the sea , tho &apos; you mayn &apos;t believe it-- ALICE I never said I didn &apos;t .
MOCK TURTLE You did .
GRYPHON Hold your tongue !
MOCK TURTLE We had the best of educations--in fact , we went to school every day .
ALICE I &apos;ve been to a day school too ; you needn &apos;t be so proud as all that .
MOCK TURTLE With extras ?
ALICE Yes , we learned French and music .
MOCK TURTLE And washing ?
ALICE Certainly not !
&#91; Illustration &#93; MOCK TURTLE Ah !
Then yours wasn &apos;t a really good school .
Now at _ ours _ they had at the end of the bill , French , music , _ and washing _ --extra .
ALICE You couldn &apos;t have wanted it much ; living at the bottom of the sea .
MOCK TURTLE I couldn &apos;t afford to learn it , I only took the regular course .
ALICE What was that ?
MOCK TURTLE Reeling and writhing , of course , to begin with , and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision .
ALICE I never heard of Uglification .
What is it ?
GRYPHON Never heard of uglifying !
You know what to beautify is , I suppose ?
ALICE Yes , it means--to--make--anything--prettier .
GRYPHON Well then , if you don &apos;t know what to uglify is , you _ are _ a simpleton .
ALICE What else had you to learn ?
MOCK TURTLE Well , there was Mystery ; Mystery , ancient and modern , with Seaography , then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger eel , that used to come once a week ; what _ he _ taught us was Drawling , Stretching , and Fainting in Coils .
ALICE What was _ that _ like ?
MOCK TURTLE Well , I can &apos;t show it you , myself .
I &apos;m too stiff .
And the Gryphon never learned it .
GRYPHON Hadn &apos;t time ; I went to the Classical master , though .
He was an old crab , _ he _ was .
MOCK TURTLE I never went to him ; he taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say .
GRYPHON So he did , so he did .
ALICE And how many hours a day did you do lessons ?
MOCK TURTLE Ten hours the first day , nine the next , and so on .
ALICE What a curious plan !
GRYPHON That &apos;s the reason they &apos;re called lessons , because they lessen from day to day .
ALICE Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday ?
MOCK TURTLE Of course it was .
ALICE And how did you manage on the twelfth ?
GRYPHON That &apos;s enough about lessons , tell her something about the games now .
&#91; _ MOCK TURTLE sighs deeply , draws back of one flapper across his eyes .
He looks at ALICE and tries to speak but sobs choke his voice . _ &#93; GRYPHON &#91; _ Punching him in the back . _ &#93; Same as if he had a bone in his throat .
MOCK TURTLE &#91; _ With tears running down his cheeks . _ &#93; You may not have lived much under the sea-- ALICE I haven &apos;t .
MOCK TURTLE And perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster .
ALICE I once tasted--no , never !
