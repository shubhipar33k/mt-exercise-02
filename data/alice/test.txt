MOCK TURTLE So you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is .
ALICE No , indeed .
What sort of a dance is it ?
GRYPHON Why , you first form into a line along the seashore .
MOCK TURTLE Two lines ; seals , turtles , salmon , and so on ; then , when you &apos;ve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way-- GRYPHON _ That _ generally takes some time .
MOCK TURTLE You advance twice-- GRYPHON Each with a lobster as a partner .
MOCK TURTLE Of course , advance twice , set to partners .
GRYPHON Change lobsters , and retire in same order .
MOCK TURTLE Then you know , you throw the-- GRYPHON The lobsters !
MOCK TURTLE As far out to sea as you can-- GRYPHON Swim after them !
MOCK TURTLE Turn a somersault in the sea .
GRYPHON Change lobsters again !
MOCK TURTLE Back to land again , and--that &apos;s all the first figure .
ALICE It must be a very pretty dance .
MOCK TURTLE Would you like to see a little of it ?
ALICE Very much indeed .
MOCK TURTLE Come , let &apos;s try the first figure .
We can do it without lobsters , you know ; which shall sing ?
GRYPHON Oh , _ you _ sing , I &apos;ve forgotten the words .
&#91; _ Creatures solemnly dance round and round ALICE , treading on her toes , waving fore-paws to mark time while MOCK TURTLE sings . _ &#93; First Verse &quot; Will you walk a little faster ! &quot;
said a whiting to a snail , &quot; There &apos;s a porpoise close behind us , and he &apos;s treading on my tail .
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance ?
Will you , won &apos;t you , will you , won &apos;t you , will you join the dance ?
Will you , won &apos;t you , will you , won &apos;t you , won &apos;t you join the dance ?
Second Verse &quot; You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! &quot;
But the snail replied , &quot; Too far , too far ! &quot;
and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance .
&#91; _ The creatures dance against ALICE , pushing her back and forth between them .
She protests and finally escapes ; they bump against each other . _ &#93; ALICE Thank you ; it &apos;s a very interesting dance to watch , and I do so like that curious song about the whiting .
MOCK TURTLE Oh , as to the whiting , they--you &apos;ve seen them , of course ?
ALICE Yes , I &apos;ve often seen them at din-- &#91; _ Checks herself hastily . _ &#93; MOCK TURTLE I don &apos;t know where Din may be , but if you &apos;ve seen them so often , of course you know what they &apos;re like .
ALICE I believe so , they have their tails in their mouths--and they &apos;re all over crumbs .
MOCK TURTLE You &apos;re wrong about the crumbs , crumbs would all wash off in the sea .
But they _ have _ their tails in their mouths ; and the reason is-- &#91; _ MOCK TURTLE yawns and shuts his eyes . _ &#93; Tell her about the reason and all that .
GRYPHON The reason is , that they _ would _ go with the lobsters to the dance .
So they got thrown out to sea .
So they had to fall a long way .
So they got their tails fast in their mouths .
So they couldn &apos;t get them out again .
That &apos;s all .
ALICE Thank you , it &apos;s very interesting .
I never knew so much about a whiting before .
GRYPHON I can tell you more than that , if you like .
Do you know why it &apos;s called a whiting ?
ALICE I never thought about it .
Why ?
GRYPHON _ It does the boots and shoes . _ ALICE Does the boots and shoes !
GRYPHON Why , what are _ your _ shoes done with ?
I mean , what makes them so shiny ?
ALICE They &apos;re done with blacking , I believe .
GRYPHON Boots and shoes under the sea , are done with whiting .
Now you know .
ALICE And what are they made of ?
GRYPHON Soles and eels , of course ; any shrimp could have told you that .
ALICE If I &apos;d been the whiting , I &apos;d have said to the porpoise , &quot; Keep back , please ; we don &apos;t want _ you _ with us . &quot;
MOCK TURTLE They were obliged to have him with them , no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise .
ALICE Wouldn &apos;t it really ?
MOCK TURTLE Of course not ; why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey , I should say , &quot; With what porpoise ? &quot;
ALICE Don &apos;t you mean purpose ?
MOCK TURTLE I mean what I say .
&#91; Illustration &#93; GRYPHON Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille ?
Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song ?
ALICE Oh , a song please , if the Mock Turtle would be so kind .
GRYPHON Um !
No accounting for tastes !
Sing her &quot; Turtle Soup , &quot; will you , old fellow ?
MOCK TURTLE &#91; _ Sighs deeply and sometimes choked with sobs , sings . _ &#93; &quot; Beautiful Soup , so rich and green , Waiting in a hot tureen !
Who for such dainties would not stoop ?
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
Beau--ootiful Soo--op , Beau--ootiful Soo--oop , Soo--oop of the e-e-evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup . &quot;
WHITE RABBIT &#91; _ Enters , stretching out a red and white checked sash with which he separates ALICE from the creatures . _ &#93; Check !
MOCK TURTLE They won &apos;t let her stay in our square .
WHITE RABBIT The Queen is coming this way .
GRYPHON She &apos;ll chop our heads off .
Come on , come on , let &apos;s fly !
&#91; _ The MOCK TURTLE and GRYPHON grab ALICE and fly into the air . _ &#93; CURTAIN &#91; _ The Curtain rises to reveal small silhouettes of the GRYPHON , MOCK TURTLE , and ALICE in an orange-colored moon far away in the sky .
Down below the WHITE RABBIT is shouting to them , &quot; You &apos;ll be safe in the March Hare &apos;s garden .
&quot; _ &#93; CURTAIN ACT II SCENE _ The March Hare &apos;s garden , showing part of the Duchess &apos; house .
On a small platform there is a tea table , set with many cups , continuing into wings to give impression of limitless length .
THE MARCH HARE , HATTER , and DORMOUSE are crowded at one end .
ALICE sits on the ground where she has been dropped from the sky .
Finding herself not bruised she rises and approaches the table . _ MARCH HARE and HATTER No room !
No room !
ALICE There &apos;s plenty of room !
&#91; _ She sits in a large armchair at one end of the table . _ &#93; I don &apos;t know who you are .
MARCH HARE I am the March Hare , that &apos;s the Hatter , and this is the Dormouse .
Have some wine ?
ALICE I don &apos;t see any wine .
MARCH HARE There isn &apos;t any .
ALICE Then it wasn &apos;t very civil of you to offer it .
MARCH HARE It wasn &apos;t very civil of you to sit down without being invited .
ALICE I didn &apos;t know it was _ your _ table ; it &apos;s laid for a great many more than three .
HATTER Your hair wants cutting .
ALICE You should learn not to make personal remarks ; it &apos;s very rude .
HATTER Why is a raven like a writing-desk ?
ALICE Come , we shall have some fun now !
I &apos;m glad you &apos;ve begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that .
MARCH HARE So you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ?
&#91; Illustration : HATTER : Your hair wants cutting . &#93;
ALICE Exactly so .
MARCH HARE Then you should say what you mean .
ALICE I do ; at least--at least I mean what I say--that &apos;s the same thing , you know .
HATTER Not the same thing a bit !
Why , you might just as well say that &quot; I see what I eat &quot; is the same thing as , &quot; I eat what I see ! &quot;
MARCH HARE You might just as well say that &quot; I like what I get , &quot; is the same thing as &quot; I get what I like . &quot;
DORMOUSE You might just as well say that &quot; I breathe when I sleep &quot; is the same thing as &quot; I sleep when I breathe . &quot;
HATTER It _ is _ the same thing with you .
&#91; _ Takes out his watch , looks at it uneasily , shakes it , holds it to his ear . _ &#93; What day of the month is it ?
ALICE The fourth .
HATTER Two days wrong .
I told you butter wouldn &apos;t suit the works !
MARCH HARE It was the _ best _ butter .
HATTER Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well ; you shouldn &apos;t have put it in with the bread-knife-- MARCH HARE &#91; _ Takes the watch , looks at it gloomily , dips it into his cup of tea and looks at it again but doesn &apos;t know what else to say . _ &#93; It was the _ best _ butter , you know .
ALICE What a funny watch !
It tells the day of the month , and doesn &apos;t tell what o &apos;clock it is .
HATTER Why should it ?
Does _ your _ watch tell you what year it is ?
ALICE Of course not , but that &apos;s because it stays the same year for such a long time together .
HATTER Which is just the case with _ mine _ .
ALICE I don &apos;t quite understand you .
What you said had no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English .
HATTER &#91; _ Pouring some hot tea on the DORMOUSE &apos;S nose . _ &#93; The Dormouse is asleep again .
DORMOUSE Of course , of course , just what I was going to remark myself .
HATTER Have you guessed the riddle yet ?
ALICE No , I give it up , what &apos;s the answer ?
HATTER I haven &apos;t the slightest idea .
MARCH HARE Nor I. ALICE I think you might do something better with the time , than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers .
HATTER If you knew Time as well as I do , you wouldn &apos;t talk about wasting _ it _ .
It &apos;s _ him _ .
ALICE I don &apos;t know what you mean .
HATTER Of course you don &apos;t .
I dare say you never even spoke to Time .
ALICE Perhaps not , but I know I have to beat time when I learn music .
HATTER Ah , that accounts for it .
He won &apos;t stand beating .
Now , if you only kept on good terms with him , he &apos;d do almost anything you liked with the clock .
For instance , suppose it were nine o &apos;clock in the morning , just time to begin lessons .
You &apos;d only have to whisper a hint to Time , and round goes the clock in a twinkling !
Half past one , time for dinner .
MARCH HARE I only wish it was .
ALICE That would be grand , certainly , but then--I shouldn &apos;t be hungry for it , you know .
HATTER Not at first , perhaps , but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked .
ALICE Is that the way _ you _ manage ?
HATTER Not I , we quarreled last March--just before _ he _ went mad , you know .
It was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing .
&quot; Twinkle , twinkle , little bat !
How I wonder what you &apos;re at ! &quot;
You know the song , perhaps .
ALICE I &apos;ve heard something like it .
DORMOUSE Twinkle , twinkle , twinkle-- HATTER Well , I &apos;d hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled out , &quot; He &apos;s murdering the time !
Off with his head ! &quot;
ALICE How dreadfully savage !
HATTER And ever since that , he won &apos;t do a thing I ask !
It &apos;s always six o &apos;clock now .
ALICE Is that the reason so many tea things are put out here ?
HATTER Yes , that &apos;s it ; it &apos;s always tea time , and we &apos;ve no time to wash the things between whiles .
ALICE Then you keep moving round , I suppose ?
HATTER Exactly so , as the things get used up .
ALICE But when you come to the beginning again ?
MARCH HARE Suppose we change the subject .
I vote the young lady tells us a story .
ALICE I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t know one .
MARCH HARE and HATTER Then the Dormouse shall .
Wake up Dormouse .
&#91; _ They pinch him on both sides at once . _ &#93; DORMOUSE &#91; _ Opens his eyes slowly and says in a hoarse , feeble voice . _ &#93; I wasn &apos;t asleep , I heard every word you fellows were saying .
MARCH HARE Tell us a story .
ALICE Yes , please do !
HATTER And be quick about it , or you &apos;ll be asleep again before it &apos;s done .
DORMOUSE Once upon a time there were three little sisters , and their names were Elsie , Lacie , and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well-- ALICE What did they live on ?
&#91; Illustration &#93; DORMOUSE They lived on treacle .
ALICE They couldn &apos;t have done that , you know , they &apos;d have been ill . DORMOUSE So they were , _ very _ ill . ALICE But why did they live at the bottom of a well ?
MARCH HARE Take some more tea .
ALICE I &apos;ve had nothing yet , so I can &apos;t take more .
HATTER You mean , you can &apos;t take _ less _ ; it &apos;s very easy to take _ more _ than nothing .
ALICE Nobody asked _ your _ opinion .
HATTER Who &apos;s making personal remarks now ?
ALICE &#91; _ Helps herself to tea and bread and butter . _ &#93; Why did they live at the bottom of a well ?
DORMOUSE &#91; _ Takes a minute or two to think . _ &#93; It was a treacle-well .
ALICE There &apos;s no such thing !
HATTER and MARCH HARE Sh !
Sh !
DORMOUSE If you can &apos;t be civil , you &apos;d better finish the story for yourself .
ALICE &#91; _ Very humbly . _ &#93; No , please go on .
I won &apos;t interrupt you again .
I dare say there may be _ one _ .
DORMOUSE One , indeed !
And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw , you know-- ALICE What did they draw ?
DORMOUSE Treacle .
HATTER I want a clean cup .
Let &apos;s all move one place on .
&#91; _ HATTER moves on , DORMOUSE takes his place , MARCH HARE takes DORMOUSE &apos;S place and ALICE unwillingly takes MARCH HARE &apos;S place . _ &#93; ALICE I &apos;m worse off than I was before .
You &apos;ve upset the milk jug into your plate .
MARCH HARE It wasn &apos;t very civil of you to sit down without being invited .
ALICE Where did they draw the treacle from ?
HATTER You can draw water out of a water well , so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well--eh , stupid ?
ALICE But they were _ in _ the well .
DORMOUSE Of course they were--well in .
They were learning to draw , and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M-- ALICE Why with an M ?
&#91; Illustration &#93; MARCH HARE Why not ?
&#91; _ ALICE is silent and confused .
HATTER pinches DORMOUSE to wake him up . _ &#93; DORMOUSE &#91; _ Wakes with a little shriek and continues . _ &#93; --that begins with an M , such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchness--you know you say things are &quot; much of a muchness &quot; --did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ?
HATTER Did you ?
ALICE Really now you ask me , I don &apos;t think-- HATTER Then you shouldn &apos;t talk .
MARCH HARE No !
ALICE &#91; _ Rises and walks away . _ &#93; You are very rude .
It &apos;s the stupidest tea party I ever was at in all my life-- &#91; _ WHITE RABBIT enters carrying a huge envelope with a seal and crown on it . _ &#93; MARCH HARE and HATTER No room !
no room !
&#91; _ Rabbit pays no attention to them but goes to the house and raps loudly .
A footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and powdered hair opens the door . _ &#93; WHITE RABBIT For the Duchess .
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet .
FROG From the Queen .
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet .
&#91; _ WHITE RABBIT bows and goes out . _ &#93; MARCH HARE and HATTER &#91; _ To WHITE RABBIT . _ &#93; No room !
No room !
No room !
&#91; _ The FROG disappears into the house but leaves the door open .
There is a terrible din and many sauce pans fly out . _ &#93; MARCH HARE She &apos;s at it again .
HATTER It &apos;s perfectly disgusting .
MARCH HARE Let &apos;s move on .
&#91; _ The platform moves off with table , chairs , MARCH HARE , HATTER , and DORMOUSE .
Meanwhile the FROG has come out again and is sitting near the closed door , staring stupidly at the sky .
ALICE goes to the door timidly and knocks . _ &#93; FROG There &apos;s no sort of use in knocking , and that for two reasons : first , because I &apos;m on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they &apos;re making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you .
ALICE Please then , how am I to get in ?
FROG There might be some sense in your knocking if we had the door between us .
For instance , if you were _ inside _ , you might knock , and I could let you out , you know .
ALICE How am I to get in ?
FROG I shall sit here , till tomorrow .
&#91; _ The door opens and a large plate skims out straight at the FROG &apos;S head ; it grazes his nose and breaks into pieces . _ &#93; &#91; _ FROG acts as if nothing had happened . _ &#93; Or next day , maybe .
ALICE How am I to get in ?
FROG _ Are _ you to get in at all ?
That &apos;s the first question , you know .
ALICE It &apos;s really dreadful the way all you creatures argue .
It &apos;s enough to drive one crazy .
FROG I shall sit here , on and off , for days and days .
ALICE But what am I to do ?
FROG Anything you like .
&#91; _ He begins to whistle . _ &#93; ALICE Where &apos;s the servant whose business it is to answer the door ?
FROG Which door ?
ALICE _ This _ door , of course !
&#91; Illustration : FROG : I shall sit here till tomorrow . &#93;
&#91; _ The FROG looks at the door , and rubs his thumb on it to see if the paint will come off . _ &#93; &#91; Illustration &#93; FROG To answer the door ?
What &apos;s it been asking for ?
ALICE I don &apos;t know what you mean .
FROG I speaks English , doesn &apos;t I ?
Or are you deaf ?
What did it ask you ?
ALICE Nothing !
I &apos;ve been knocking at it .
FROG Shouldn &apos;t do that--shouldn &apos;t do that , vexes it , you know .
&#91; _ He kicks the door . _ &#93; You let _ it _ alone , and it &apos;ll let _ you _ alone , you know .
ALICE Oh , there &apos;s no use talking to you-- &#91; _ She starts to open the door just as the DUCHESS comes out carrying a pig in baby &apos;s clothes .
She sneezes--FROG sneezes and ALICE sneezes . _ &#93; DUCHESS If everybody minded her own business-- &#91; _ She sneezes . _ &#93; ALICE It &apos;s pepper .
DUCHESS Of course , my cook puts it in the soup .
ALICE There &apos;s certainly too much pepper in the soup .
DUCHESS Sneeze then and get rid of it !
&#91; _ DUCHESS begins to sing to the baby , giving it a violent shake at the end of every line of the lullaby . _ &#93; &quot; Speak roughly to your little boy , And beat him when he sneezes ; &#91; _ FROG and ALICE sneeze . _ &#93; He only does it to annoy , Because he knows it teases .
&#91; _ DUCHESS sneezes , FROG sneezes , ALICE sneezes . _ &#93; I speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes ; &#91; _ FROG sneezes , ALICE sneezes . _ &#93; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases ! &quot;
&#91; _ DUCHESS sneezes , FROG sneezes , ALICE sneezes , DUCHESS gasps and gives a tremendous sneeze . _ &#93; ALICE Oh dear !
&#91; _ She jumps aside as kettles and pots come flying out of the door .
The DUCHESS pays no attention . _ &#93; What a cook to have !
&#91; _ She calls inside . _ &#93; Oh !
_ please _ mind what you &apos;re doing !
&#91; _ Another pan comes out and almost hits the baby . _ &#93; Oh !
there goes his _ precious _ nose !
DUCHESS If everybody minded her own business , the world would go round a deal faster than it does .
ALICE Which would not be an advantage .
Just think what work it would make with the day and night !
You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis-- DUCHESS Talking of axes , chop off her head !
&#91; _ The head of a grinning Cheshire cat appears in a tree above a wall . _ &#93; ALICE Oh , what &apos;s that ?
DUCHESS Cat , of course .
ALICE Why does it grin like that ?
DUCHESS It &apos;s a Cheshire cat !
and that &apos;s why .
&#91; _ To baby . _ &#93; Pig !
&#91; Illustration : DUCHESS : I speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes . &#93;
ALICE I didn &apos;t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I didn &apos;t know that cats _ could _ grin .
DUCHESS They all can and most of &apos; em do .
ALICE I don &apos;t know of any that do .
DUCHESS You don &apos;t know much and that &apos;s a fact .
Here , you may nurse it a bit , if you like !
&#91; _ Flings the baby at ALICE . _ &#93; I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen .
&#91; _ She goes into the house . _ &#93; ALICE If I don &apos;t take this child away with me , they &apos;re sure to kill it in a day or two .
Cheshire Puss , would you tell me please , which way I ought to walk from here ?
CAT That depends a good deal on where you want to get to .
ALICE I don &apos;t much care where-- CAT Then it doesn &apos;t matter which way you walk .
ALICE So long as I get _ somewhere _ .
CAT Oh , you &apos;re sure to do that , if you only walk long enough .
ALICE Please , will you tell me what sort of people live about here ?
CAT All mad people .
ALICE But I don &apos;t want to go among mad people .
CAT Oh , you can &apos;t help that ; we &apos;re all mad here .
I &apos;m mad .
He &apos;s mad .
He &apos;s dreaming now , and what do you think he &apos;s dreaming about ?
ALICE &#91; _ Goes to the FROG to scrutinize his face . _ &#93; Nobody could guess that .
CAT Why , about you !
And if he left off dreaming about you , where do you suppose you &apos;d be ?
ALICE Where I am now , of course .
CAT Not you .
You &apos;d be nowhere .
Why , you &apos;re only a sort of thing in his dream ; and you &apos;re mad too .
ALICE How do you know I &apos;m mad ?
CAT You must be , or you wouldn &apos;t have come here .
ALICE How do you know that you &apos;re mad ?
CAT To begin with , a dog &apos;s not mad .
You grant that ?
ALICE I suppose so .
CAT Well then , you see a dog growls when it &apos;s angry , and wags its tail when it &apos;s pleased .
Now I growl when I &apos;m pleased , and wag my tail when I &apos;m angry .
Therefore I &apos;m mad .
ALICE I call it purring , not growling .
&#91; Illustration &#93; CAT Call it what you like .
Do you play croquet with the Queen today ?
ALICE I should like it very much , but I haven &apos;t been invited yet .
CAT You &apos;ll see me there .
&#91; _ Vanishes . _ &#93; ALICE &#91; _ To squirming baby . _ &#93; Oh , dear , it &apos;s heavy and so ugly .
Don &apos;t grunt--Oh--Oh--it &apos;s a--pig .
Please Mr. Footman take it !
FROG &#91; _ Rises with dignity , whistles and disappears into the house ; a kettle comes bounding out .
ALICE puts pig down and it crawls off . _ &#93; CAT &#91; _ Appearing again . _ &#93; By-the-bye , what became of the baby ?
ALICE It turned into a pig .
CAT I thought it would .
&#91; _ Vanishes . _ &#93; &#91; _ FROG comes out of the house with hedgehogs and flamingoes . _ &#93; CAT &#91; _ Reappearing . _ &#93; Did you say pig , or fig ?
ALICE I said pig ; and I wish you wouldn &apos;t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly ; you make one quite giddy .
CAT All right .
&#91; _ It vanishes slowly . _ &#93; &#91; _ FROG puts flamingoes down and reenters house .
While ALICE is examining the flamingoes curiously , TWEEDLEDUM and TWEEDLEDEE , each with an arm round the other &apos;s neck , sidestep in and stand looking at ALICE . _ &#93; ALICE &#91; _ Turns , sees them , starts in surprise and involuntarily whispers . _ &#93; Tweedle--dee .
DUM Dum !
DEE If you think we &apos;re waxworks , you ought to pay .
DUM Contrariwise , if you think we &apos;re alive , you ought to speak .
DEE The first thing in a visit is to say &quot; How d &apos;ye do ? &quot;
and shake hands !
&#91; _ The brothers give each other a hug , then hold out the two hands that are free , to shake hands with her .
ALICE does not like shaking hands with either of them first , for fear of hurting the other one &apos;s feelings ; she takes hold of both hands at once and they all dance round in a ring , quite naturally to music , &quot; Here we go round the mulberry bush .
&quot; _ &#93; ALICE Would you tell me which road leads out of-- DEE What shall I repeat to her ?
DUM The &quot; Walrus and the Carpenter &quot; is the longest .
&#91; _ Gives his brother an affectionate hug . _ &#93; DEE The sun was shining-- ALICE If it &apos;s very long , would you please tell me first which road-- DEE The moon was shining sulkily .
DUM The sea was wet as wet could be-- DEE O Oysters , come and walk with us The Walrus did beseech-- DUM &#91; _ Looks at DEE . _ &#93; A pleasant walk , a pleasant talk , Along the briny beach-- DEE &#91; _ Looks at DUM . _ &#93; The eldest Oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head-- DUM &#91; _ Looks at DEE . _ &#93; Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed .
DEE But four young Oysters hurried up And yet another four-- DUM And thick and fast they came at last , And more , and more , and more-- DEE The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so , DUM And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low , DEE And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row .
DUM &quot; A loaf of bread , &quot; the Walrus said , &quot; Is what we chiefly need .
DEE Now if you &apos;re ready , Oysters dear , We can begin to feed . &quot;
DUM &quot; But not on us ! &quot;
the Oysters cried , Turning a little blue .
DEE &quot; The night is fine , &quot; the Walrus said , &quot; Do you admire the view ? &quot;
DUM The Carpenter said nothing but &quot; Cut us another slice .
I wish you were not quite so deaf-- I &apos;ve had to ask you twice ! &quot;
DEE &quot; It seems a shame , &quot; the Walrus said , &quot; To play them such a trick , After we &apos;ve brought them out so far , And made them trot so quick ! &quot;
DUM &quot; O , Oysters , &quot; said the Carpenter , &quot; You &apos;ve had a pleasant run !
DEE Shall we be trotting home again ? &quot;
DUM But answer came there none-- DEE And this was scarcely odd , because DUM They &apos;d eaten every-- DEE &#91; _ Interrupts in a passion , pointing to a white rattle on the ground . _ &#93; Do you see _ that _ ?
ALICE It &apos;s only a rattle-- DUM &#91; _ Stamps wildly and tears his hair . _ &#93; I knew it was !
It &apos;s spoilt of course .
My nice new rattle !
&#91; _ To DEE . _ &#93; You agree to have a battle ?
&#91; _ He collects sauce pans and pots . _ &#93; DEE &#91; _ Picks up a sauce pan . _ &#93; I suppose so .
Let &apos;s fight till dinner .
&#91; _ They go out hand in hand . _ &#93; ALICE &#91; _ Hears music . _ &#93; I wonder what is going to happen next .
&#91; _ She backs down stage respectfully as the KING and QUEEN OF HEARTS enter , followed by the KNAVE OF HEARTS carrying the KING &apos;S crown on a crimson velvet cushion , and the WHITE RABBIT and others .
When they come opposite to ALICE they stop and look at her . _ &#93; &#91; _ The DUCHESS comes out of her house . _ &#93; QUEEN &#91; _ To the KNAVE . _ &#93; Who is this ?
&#91; Illustration &#93; KNAVE &#91; _ Bows three times , smiles and giggles . _ &#93; QUEEN Idiot !
What &apos;s your name , child ?
ALICE My name is Alice , so please your Majesty .
QUEEN Off with her head !
Off-- ALICE Nonsense !
KING Consider , my dear , she is only a child .
QUEEN Can you play croquet ?
ALICE Yes .
QUEEN Come on then .
Get to your places .
Where are the mallets ?
DUCHESS Here .
&#91; _ The FROG appears with the flamingoes and hedgehogs . _ &#93; QUEEN Off with his head !
&#91; _ No one pays any attention . _ &#93; KNAVE What fun !
ALICE What is the fun ?
KNAVE Why she ; it &apos;s all her fancy , that .
They never execute anyone .
ALICE What does one do ?
QUEEN Get to your places !
&#91; _ She takes a flamingo , uses its neck as a mallet and a hedgehog as a ball .
The FROG doubles himself into an arch .
The KING does the same with the followers and the KNAVE offers himself as an arch for ALICE .
Even though ALICE does not notice him he holds the arch position .
The QUEEN shouts at intervals , &quot; Off with his head , off with her head .
&quot; _ &#93; ALICE Where are the Chess Queens ?
RABBIT Under sentence of execution .
ALICE What for ?
RABBIT Did you say , &quot; what a pity &quot; ?
ALICE No , I didn &apos;t .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s at all a pity .
I said , &quot; What for ? &quot;
RABBIT They boxed the Queen &apos;s ears .
&#91; _ ALICE gives a little scream of laughter . _ &#93; RABBIT Oh , hush !
The Queen will hear you !
You see they came rather late and the Queen said--Oh dear , the Queen hears me-- &#91; _ He hurries away . _ &#93; ALICE &#91; _ Noticing the KNAVE who still pretends to be an arch . _ &#93; How _ can _ you go on thinking so quietly , with your head downwards ?
KNAVE What does it matter where my body happens to be ?
My mind goes on working just the same .
